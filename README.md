# Simple Neural Network
This is a simple Neural Network with one hidden layer and Backpropagation for image classificaiton. As data source, the MNIST database is used (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist). This database contains 60.000 examples for training and 10.000 examples for testing the Neural Network.

To execute the Python script, just type `python neural_network.py` in a console.
